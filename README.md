# HOG-SVM-Pipe
Computer Vision Project:  
Classification of images into 10 classes. Dataset from CalTech101 - http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/.  
The pipe that I chose was HOG (for representing the images) and SVM (learning model).   
All the code is provided in a .py file. In addition I provide an Hebrew report (PDF).
